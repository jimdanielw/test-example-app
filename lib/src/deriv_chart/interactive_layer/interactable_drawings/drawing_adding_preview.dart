/// tool creation process. It's responsible for:
///
/// 1. Displaying a preview of the drawing being created
/// 2. Showing alignment guides, hints, or other visual aids
/// 3. Handling user interactions during the drawing creation process
/// 4. Coordinating with the [InteractiveLayerBehaviour] to manage
///    platform-specific interactions (mobile vs desktop)
///
/// The preview exists only during the drawing addition lifecycle and is removed
/// once the drawing is fully created and added to the chart. Different drawing
/// tools will implement their own specific preview behaviors by extending this
/// class.

/// See also:
///   * [InteractableDrawing], which this preview helps to create

  /// 1. Capture coordinates needed to define the drawing's shape and position
  /// 2. Update the underlying [interactableDrawing] with these coordinates
  /// 3. Determine when the drawing creation is complete.

  /// - A horizontal line may require just one tap to define its position
  /// - A trend line requires two taps to define start and end points
  /// - A rectangle or triangle may require multiple taps to define vertices
  ///

  /// - [details]: Information about the tap event
